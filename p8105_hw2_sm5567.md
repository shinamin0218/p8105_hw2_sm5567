### Problem 0

This solution focuses on a reproducible report containing code and text
necessary for Problems 1-3, and is organized as an R Project. This was
not prepared as a GitHub repo; examples for repository structure and git
commits should be familiar from other elements of the course.

Throughout, we use appropriate text to describe our code and results,
and use clear styling to ensure code is readable.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

### Problem 1

We clean the 538 `pols` data, which provides information on the number
of national politicians who are democratic or republican at any given
time. There are some values for which `prez_gop` is `2` – these are
months in which Ford became President following Nixon’s resignation. In
the new `president` variable created as part of our data cleaning, we
code these as `gop` (same as values when `prez_gop` is `1`).

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

pols =
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez"))
```

We also clean the 538 `snp` data, which contains information related to
Standard & Poor’s stock market index.

``` r
snp = 
  read_csv(
    "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv",
    col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"))) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    year = if_else(year > 2023, year - 100, year)) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, close) 
```

Finally, we tidy the `unemployment` data so that it can be merged with
the `pols` and `snp` datasets.

``` r
unemployment = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

Now we merge the three datasets!

``` r
data_538 = 
  left_join(pols, snp) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment)

str(data_538)
## tibble [822 × 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##  $ year        : num [1:822] 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 ...
##  $ month       : chr [1:822] "January" "February" "March" "April" ...
##  $ month_num   : int [1:822] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
##  $ gov_gop     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
##  $ sen_gop     : num [1:822] 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 ...
##  $ rep_gop     : num [1:822] 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 ...
##  $ gov_dem     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
##  $ sen_dem     : num [1:822] 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 ...
##  $ rep_dem     : num [1:822] 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 ...
##  $ president   : chr [1:822] "dem" "dem" "dem" "dem" ...
##  $ month_abb   : chr [1:822] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" ...
##  $ close       : num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
##  $ unemployment: num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
```

Notice that there are some `NA` values in the `close` and `unemployment`
variables, which indicate that the value of these variables is missing
at those locations.

Let’s talk about the 538 datasets. The `pols` data has 822 observations
and 11 variables and tells us about the party affiliation distribution
(democrat or republican) for governors and senators for a given year
from years 1947 to 2015. It also tells us whether the sitting president
was a democrat or republican. The `snp` data has 787 observations and 3
variables, ranging from years 1950 to 2015. The `unemployment` data has
816 observations and 3 variables ranging from years 1948 to 2015. In
Januarys in or after 1975 in which a democrat was president, the
**average unemployment rate was 6.57**. The average unemployment rate
over the same time period in which a republican was president was 6.47.

### Problem 2

This problem uses the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, available as an Excel
file on the course website.

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

## Reading and cleaning Trash Wheel Collection Data

``` r
mr_trash_wheel =
  read_excel("./202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
             range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30,
         trash_wheel_data = 1,
         year = as.numeric(year))

prof_trash_wheel =
  read_excel("./202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
             sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
             range = cell_cols("A:M")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30,
         trash_wheel_data = 2)

gwy_trash_wheel =
  read_excel("./202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
             sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
             range = cell_cols("A:J")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30,
         trash_wheel_data = 3)
```

## Merging three data sets

``` r
trash_wheel_data =
 bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel, gwy_trash_wheel) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```
