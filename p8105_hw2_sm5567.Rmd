### Problem 0

This solution focuses on a reproducible report containing code and text necessary for Problems 1-3, and is organized as an R Project. This was not prepared as a GitHub repo; examples for repository structure and git commits should be familiar from other elements of the course.

Throughout, we use appropriate text to describe our code and results, and use clear styling to ensure code is readable. 

```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```


### Problem 1

We clean the 538 `pols` data, which provides information on the number of national politicians who are democratic or republican at any given time. There are some values for which `prez_gop` is `2` -- these are months in which Ford became President following Nixon's resignation. In the new `president` variable created as part of our data cleaning, we code these as `gop` (same as values when `prez_gop` is `1`).

```{r clean_538_pols}
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

pols = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez")) 
```

We also clean the 538 `snp` data, which contains information related to Standard & Poorâ€™s stock market index.

```{r clean_538_snp}
snp = 
  read_csv(
    "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv",
    col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"))) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    year = if_else(year > 2023, year - 100, year)) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, close) 
```

Finally, we tidy the `unemployment` data so that it can be merged with the `pols` and `snp` datasets.

```{r clean_538_unemp}
unemployment = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

Now we merge the three datasets!

```{r merge_538}
data_538 = 
  left_join(pols, snp) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment)

str(data_538)
```

Notice that there are some `NA` values in the `close` and `unemployment` variables, which indicate that the value of these variables is missing at those locations.

Let's talk about the 538 datasets. The `pols` data has `r nrow(pols)` observations and `r ncol(pols)` variables and tells us about the party affiliation distribution (democrat or republican) for governors and senators for a given year from years `r pols |> pull(year) |> min()` to `r pols |> pull(year) |> max()`. It also tells us whether the sitting president was a democrat or republican. The `snp` data has `r nrow(snp)` observations and `r ncol(snp)` variables, ranging from years `r snp |> pull(year) |> min()` to `r snp |> pull(year) |> max()`. The `unemployment` data has `r nrow(unemployment)` observations and `r ncol(unemployment)` variables ranging from years `r unemployment |> pull(year) |> min()` to `r unemployment |> pull(year) |> max()`. In Januarys in or after 1975 in which a democrat was president, the **average unemployment rate was `r filter(data_538, month == "January", year >= 1975, president == "dem") |> pull(unemployment) |> mean() |> round(2)`**.  The average unemployment rate over the same time period in which a republican was president was `r filter(data_538, month == "January", year >= 1975, president == "gop") |> pull(unemployment) |> mean() |> round(2)`.
